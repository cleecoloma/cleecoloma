## Growth Mindset
> To me, a growth mindset is the ability to adapt to a new environment and the willingness to accept changes.

#### Three Things I Do To Keep Myself In A Growth Mindset
1. **Always learning new skills** - I always make an effort to continuously learn new skills, as it helps me stay in a growth mindset by embracing opportunities for personal and professional development.
2. **Learn from mistakes** - One of the key principles I follow to maintain a growth mindset is to consistently learn from my mistakes, viewing them as valuable lessons that contribute to my ongoing growth and improvement.
3. **Aspire to be a better version of myself** - To keep myself in a growth mindset, I continually aspire to become a better version of myself, setting goals and working towards self-improvement in various aspects of life, from character and skills to personal achievements and relationships.
